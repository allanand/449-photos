        <p>At the begining of the New Year (2023), I decided to go on a week long school trip with the MSU Ski club. The trip was a 22 hour bus ride to Keystone Colorado that was both long but very entertaining and I will never forget. The picture above shows me standing at the top of the Summit showing a beautiful scenic view of the vast mountains and slopes. </p>
