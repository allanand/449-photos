        <p>At the begining of the New Year (2023), I decided to go on a week long school trip with the MSU Ski club to Keystone Colorado. There was a both a lot of partying, a lot of skiiing involved, and even a private concert with Waka Flocka. I also enjoyed my fair share of tasty dishes and meet some amazing locals I plan to keep in touch with.</p>

        The picture above shows me standing at the top of the main Summit of Keystone. In order to reach it, I took the most intimidating gondala ride of my life, which actually had 2 stops. At the end of it all, the view was beautiful and I would later ski the 3 and a half miles back down to the bottom only to repeat it several times until my legs were overworked for the day.
